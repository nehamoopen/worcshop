Writing a Reproducible Paper in R with WORCS
================

This workshop
<!--will be taught by [Caspar van Lissa](https://github.com/cjvanlissa), the author of the WORCS package, in collaboration with [RDM Support](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/research-data-management). We-->
will give you an overview of the workflow and introduce you to its use,
and aim for you to be able to get started on your own reproducible
project. [**If you’re attending the workshop, make sure to check the
Preparation paragraph**](#preparation).

## Why?

Open Science is becoming increasingly popular and relevant, and a world
of opportunity is opening up to make your work fully reproducible. This
is not without its challenges: best practices for reproducible science
include a number of tools that you may never have used or even heard of
before. *(Are you using version control? How are you managing your
dependencies? Are you writing your manuscript as an executable
document?)*

WORCS is an R package that takes you from data to published paper in a
single streamlined workflow, making the entire process of your analysis,
up to the submission of your manuscript, reproducible. The WORCS
workflow optionally facilitates pre-registration, sharing your code and
your data (safely\!), and the submission of a pre-print.

## Target audience

Anyone who would like to get started with an open and reproducible
workflow, without dealing with a mountain of new tools and platforms.
The workshop uses R, but prior experience is not required. Having the
motivation to step out of your comfort zone — and into a new one — is
the most important prerequisite.

## Desired outcome

Attendees will be able to get started on their own open, reproducible
project by the end of the workshop.
